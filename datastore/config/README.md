This folder contains sample configurations of Datastore indexes

Depending on the mode in which your Datastore runs one should choose either

- `index-datastore-native.yaml` for the Datastore in native mode;
- `index-firestore-in-datastore-mode.yaml` for the Firestore in Datastore mode.

Each of the configurations lists the indexes for the system records (e.g. `Event`) and the samples for the user-defined entities.

Feel free to modify the samples according to your needs.
